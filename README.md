# Library App

- Learnt `max-width` parameter (helped with responsive modal form)
- Learnt `data` attributes for DOM selection. Initially the `deleteBook` function used the book title to filter out the card to delete. However this method wouldn't be accurate if there were multiple books with the same title.
